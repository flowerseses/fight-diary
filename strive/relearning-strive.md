# Strive relearning diary 2023/2024

1. [Prep week](#prep-week)
2. [Week 1](#week-1)

## Prep week <a name="prep-week"></a>
Spent a weekend trying characters and getting my fingers used to the game  
Interesting: Bridget, Gio, Elphelt, Ram, Sin  
Leverless is still weird to get used to, and doing inputs still involves a bit of spamming, def something to work on  
Character notes:  
- Giovanna:  
  Spent a lot of time in s1 playing her, but she feels a bit... rote and unexciting now. Also, worried old muscle memory would make learning new things weird. Still feels solid but I definitely need a change
- Ram
  Ram has always been fun, and seems like I would enjoy her (esp with mods giving her a suit), but two issues: sword resource management seems like it would make my life really rough (either I'd always be without or never use them) and (more importantly) it seems like her DP is essential to most combo routes, as well as the rekka dash cancel. While, after 30-45 min, the dash cancel kinda clicked, this might be a thing to go back to in the future
- Elphelt
  she's wild, and coule be fun, but I'm not fully sold, something isn't clicking. I should revisit her in a few weeks
- Bridget
  the obvious choice, she is FUN. I'll have to work on timings for yoyo things, but I was definitely the most excited to learn her. Gave her a ponytail and a trans pride outfit and we're good to go
- Sin
  the unexpected choice, straightforward, the moves are all kinda cool and the chaining looks interesting, but slightly worried about managing another meter. I'll revisit him alongside Elphelt in a few weeks.  
Spent a few hours, total, in training, just getting used to the game and the buttons, then practicing some basic ram and bridget combos. I definitely won't be able to do them in a game but is good to know. Leverless makes DPs easier, and most other stuff, but it does make, weirdly enough, half-circle (and especially the 632146 super movement that strive likes) harder. Sucks that Bridget's supers are all half-circles, but we'll get there.  
Spent a few hours also digging through dustloop and watching some guide videos (most relevant: the Diaphone Bridget 101 and 201 - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBq8L1Cr9hc and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6mq2Oxw6sA, as well as https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8Z2tiBAmwA). We'll return to these at the end of week 1
Plan for week 1: don't stress about combos or anything and just jump in and play games.  

## Week 1 <a name="week-one"></a>
Day 1 was uneventful - just played a few games to not be nervous about it. I remember nothing about them, but since I started at my old floor 8 rank, I basically just lost enough, dropped down to floor 6 and called it a night. The major takeaway from this was that I still have a lot of gio muscle memory (trying to dash into 5K or 2K, trying to end combos with 214K or 236K when I want to set a yo-yo instead), and that I press buttons way, way too often. I also have NO idea what anyone added after Goldlewis does.  

Day 2, I managed to get a bit more time in, and played a solid 10-15 sets. I lost a bunch, but also got some pretty clean wins - seems like people I am getting matched with now pretty much have 1-2 combos and try to do them religiously. The games don't really matter, but takeaways:
- STOP. PRESSING. BUTTONS
- I need to stop relying on f.S so much
- Definitely have to use more yo-yo setups in normal
- Be less predictable with 214K (and figure out how to cancel it easily)
- Use 236K MUCH less, and don't always go into a followup
- Work more on using K, and try and figure out a combo and/or blockstring from a 2K or 5K (5K -> 6H and the like, or 2K -> 2D or 2H?)
- Maybe just focus on combos not including special moves to start with at all and just use yo-yo setups for oki?
- Dash-up throw works too well. Don't get too comfy with it. On the other hand, I have been landing air throws so consistently, and that rules
- Learning what other characters do and the matchups will take tame. I need to remember to not be frustrated.
- Remember that Bridget has a command grab!

Homework:  
Get some bnb combos and blockstrings  
STOP. PRESSING. BUTTONS.  
try not relying on 236K  
work on getting in and opening with 5K or 2K instead of f.S or c.S
